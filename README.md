Project developed as an test project for an interview in NodeJS

To run this project, your computer should have NodeJS installed.
The command `npm install` should be executed before the first execution.

After that, the program will run with the `npm start`command.

There are currently two versions of the program: Offline and Online.

The offline version is actually the master, and when executed ask for a file path.
The online one is the develop-online branch and already have a hardcoded Google Drive Link.

Both versions will read a file, print the results on the console and then update the original files.
